# SleepStages_prediction
Project-1 for digital signal and image management (23/24).  Main focus is comparaison of deep models running on raw eeg data and simple models trained on extracted feateures from EEG


To start both projects, simply open the `Project1.ipynb` file (or  `Project1-LiveDemo.ipynb`) in your IDE (it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code by installing the Jupyter extension to read notebooks) and create a virtual environment. If opened in Visual Studio Code, a popup should appear to create it automatically. Below are the instructions to manually create a virtual environment:

1. First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```shell
cd myenv
.\Scripts\activate
```

When starting any of the 2 projects, all the necessary packages should be installed automatically, then project should start execution.
